Hello world!

I am an aspiring environmental economist interested in climate change and environmental pollution, with broader interests in public economics and sustainable finance. I enjoy applying experimental and quasi-experimental methods to study these subjects.

I am currently a third-year Ph.D. student in Sustainable Development at Columbia University's School of International and Public Affairs (SIPA). Prior to my Ph.D., I received a MESc. in environmental and natural resource economics at Yale University. I graduated summa cum laude from Seoul National University, where I received a B.A. in economics. 

In my free time, I enjoy traveling and listening to podcasts.
